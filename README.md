# Stoptober 2022 Television

Stoptober a portmanteau of Stop and October to show you are abstaining from something during October. 

As a family, we are 🤞 giving up the TV for the whole month to raise money for the [Trussel trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/). 

While many of our friends are international, if you would prefer to donate to your local food bank that would be awesome too. For those who's company matches your donations please use the appropriate tools to make that happen. 


## About Us

We are the Rowe family. 
5 members, @Sam-Rowe and @emily-dsl are the "Adults" 😛 in the family and we have 3 lovely young folk who love to watch TV whenever they can. 

## The Challenge

For the 31 days of October the TV will be off and covered up with a Photo (from my collection). 
For every day we manage to abstain from the TV we will donate £1 per person. So assuming we manage it we will raise £155 which GitHub have kindly agreed to match donate ( a total of £310! )
