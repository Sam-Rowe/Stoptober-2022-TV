# Stoptober 2022 Television

Stoptober a portmanteau of Stop and October to show you are abstaining from something during October. 

As a family, we are ðŸ¤ž giving up the TV for the whole month to raise money for the [Trussel trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/). 

While many of our friends are international, if you would prefer to donate to your local food bank that would be awesome too. For those who's company matches your donations please use the appropriate tools to make that happen. 


## About Us

We are the Rowe family. 
5 members, @Sam-Rowe and @emily-dsl are the "Adults" ðŸ˜› in the family and we have 3 lovely young folk who love to watch TV whenever they can. 

## The Challenge

For the 31 days of October the TV will be off and covered up with a Photo (from my collection). 
For every day we manage to abstain from the TV we will donate Â£1 per person. So assuming we manage it we will raise Â£155 which GitHub have kindly agreed to match donate ( a total of Â£310! )

## The results!
We did it. 

Highlights of the last month :) 
We played more monopoly in one month than I think we have played as a family in the last decade. 
We played card games
We drew, painted, made, learned and shared more.
The kids played more outside
The kids played more together! It is a wonderfull thing to see your 13, 9 and 5 year olds playing make believe together, dressing up and just finding joy in being.
We went out to the beach, to woodlands, to explore new parks and generally found more things to do without the television. 

We used YouTube for learning more than I expected, but it shows how good it is. There are some amazing teachers out there sharing their wonderful skills, Part of this donation is for you!

Some friends and family dropped by and gave us some donations too which we decided to match.

Overall 100% recommend it as a challenge.
Maybe try 1 week first though with kids?

But learned a lot and feel more connected.
