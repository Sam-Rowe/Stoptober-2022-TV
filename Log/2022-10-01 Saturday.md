# Day1
What a day

Kids slept in!?! What a treat.

I got to go out on the Motorbike.

Time at Mote Park in Maidstone playing, walking and picnicking.

Listening to audio book

Kids made a catapult and an elastic powered card out of Kâ€™nex

A sofa bed design was made out of Duplo with a comment that my youngest wants to go work for IKEA designing furniture. Great to have an idea of what you want to do when your 5.

Kids party in the afternoon

TV has stayed off
No YouTube was played
A bit of time on the PlayStation was metered out for reward.
